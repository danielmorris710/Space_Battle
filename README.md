## Game Play 

The Earth is under attack by aliens and it is up to you to save it. Fight your way thru alien attacks to win. If you don't survive or decide to retreat, Earth is in the hands of the Aliens. **GOOD LUCK CAPTAIN**.

## Future Plans for Space Invaders


During this project, I realized there was so much more I wanted to do.
<br>

I would want to make the game have a dialogue box that way the player can do more than just press 'OK' on a windows prompt. Also add attack buttons as well as a retreat button.
